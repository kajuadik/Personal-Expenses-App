Welcome to the Personal Expenses Flutter Project!

This is a simple project that helps you keep track of your personal expenses. With this app, you can add new transactions, categorize them, and view your expense history.

Getting Started
To use this project, you'll need to have Flutter installed on your computer. If you haven't installed Flutter yet, please follow the official installation guide.

Usage
When you run the app, you'll see the home screen with a list of your expenses. To add a new expense, simply click on the "+" button in the top right corner of the screen. You'll be taken to a form where you can enter the amount, select a date, and choose a category for your expense.

Once you've added your expense, you can view it on the home screen along with your other expenses. You can also filter your expenses by category or by date.
